# Hash Table Implementation in C plus plus

This project implements a simple hash table using separate chaining. The table consists of ten buckets, and each bucket holds a linked list of nodes. Keys are placed into buckets using `key % 10`, and duplicate keys are prevented by checking all buckets before insertion.

The console menu allows you to:
• Insert a key  
• Delete a key  
• Clear the table  
• View the number of stored keys  
• Display all keys
